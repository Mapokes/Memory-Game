### The challenge

Users are able to:

- choose different theme for a game (numbers or icons)
- choose amount of player for a game (1-4)
- choose between 4x4 and 6x6 grid size
- in single player game mode every 2nd move is counted + time of the game
- for a single player game mode, result screen includes moves taken and total game time
- in multiplayer game mode, pairs found are counted for each player
- in multiplayer game mode, each player has 5 seconds to choose a button to click to reset time. If time runs out or player doesn't find a pair, his turn is lost
